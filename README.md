# BMS🔋 Battery Monitoring System (BMS) for Electric Vehicles
This project is a real-time battery monitoring and fault detection system developed using Raspberry Pi, sensors, machine learning, and a smart Daly BMS. It provides visualization, early fault alerts, and safe battery management—especially suited for EVs and lab-scale battery systems.

🚀 Features
🔍 Real-time monitoring of:

Voltage, Current, Temperature

Derived parameter: dv/dt

⚠️ Fault detection using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

📊 Live data streaming to ThingSpeak

📧 Email alerts for fault conditions (via SMTP)

🧠 Simulated battery scenarios using Python

🔌 Integration-ready with Daly Smart BMS (CAN communication)
